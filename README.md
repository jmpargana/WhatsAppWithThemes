# WhatsAppWithThemes

A clone of WhatsApp in flutter with additional features, like setting up different themes.

The UI details are heavily inspired in these [blog posts](https://medium.com/@richard.ng/whatsapp-clone-with-flutter-in-a-week-part-2-d5e394e76b22) and corresponding [repository](https://github.com/ng-kode/whatsapp_clone)

## Goal

Recreate the WhatsApp experience with some extras and setting up the whole Backend with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
